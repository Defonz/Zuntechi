Hi Ryan,

We are all available to meet on Monday and we are looking forward to 
beginning our project. Our software hut lab is from 14:00 until 16:00, 
what time would suit you best within this session?

Thanks

Emmanuel

I have been given the responsibility of analysis and requirements manager for our group; “Zuntechi” and this includes communication with you, our client. Our successful bid was for the Route Editor for a climbing guidebook website. Our group is very excited to work with you and we have many ideas for the implementation of the criteria given. We would like to arrange a meeting between our group and yourself in order to further discuss the project and build up a work relationship.
