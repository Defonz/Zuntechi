Hi Emmanuel,

Everything you need is checked in to the project hosted on https://github.com/spikeheap/jstopo. There is a wiki there (https://github.com/spikeheap/jstopo/wiki) where I've added some notes to help you along and provide a spec.

I haven't set up a server, because it's quite easy to run it locally. There's a page on the wiki which explains briefly, but you will need to download and install XAMPP. Once you've got that you can put the sample JSON from git into the 'www' folder alongside the Javascript/HTML you'll be writing and you're ready to go.

To use Git, you'll need to download and install the git client for windows (tortoisegit is a good choice) so you can clone the repository. In the meantime, you can download the JSON files directly from github.

It's good to hear you're working on it today, and I'm interested as to where you're up to. Which Javascript libraries have you looked into and which seem most appropriate? Do you have a design document or ideas on how the code will be structured, and which use-cases you will solve first? You'll need to test your code too, so have you looked at unit testing for Javascript and if it's possible?

There's a wealth of information on the internet about using Git, so I'll let you start there, but the basic principle is that you clone a repository so you have a local copy, which you can edit and push back to the server. Let me know specific problems you've got and I can answer those much more easily than giving instructions for the whole system.

Once you're up and running with it, I'd recommend putting your design documents and other things related to the project on Github, so we can all get to them.

Many thanks

Ryan
