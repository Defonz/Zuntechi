Hi Emmanuel,

Apologies for the delay in my reply. I've been off skiing for the past week and am just catching up with my emails now.

I've added some comments in-line below:

We have a few images to get us started, and aim to collect more through the spring. The database is abstracted away from the page, but can be modified if you need extra fields or want data stored differently to make life easier. As far as the page is concerned the 'database' is just the JSON data, and I have implemented portions of the JSON provider in Groovy and Grails.

That layout looks good. Ultimately we want to keep it quite minimalist, but as a first pass it's nice to have all the information to hand. When you're designing it I would make as much as you can modular, so we could (for example), remove the Country, County, Area, Range and Crag search elements if the user wants a bigger image. It's a good design if you can add and remove these individual components and the page still works.

jQuery is a good choice, and is pretty much the industry standard for Javascript now. I don't know much about Gallerie, but if it works then great. I couldn't find anything about OpenLayer, did you mean OpenLayers, the open source mapping library?

If we could meet up at some point next week after we have had our feedback on Monday that would be great, as we would like to have feedback from you too.
I am not able to make it in this afternoon unfortunately, but I am free every day from 4pm for the rest of the week, so pick a time and place and I'll meet you then.

Again, sorry for not being in touch last week, but it looks like you're making good progress.

Cheers

Ryan
