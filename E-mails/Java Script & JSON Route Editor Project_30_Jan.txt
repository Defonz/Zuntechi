Dear Ryan,

My name is Emmanuel Onah and I am currently a second year computer science student at Bangor University. This semester for our software hut module we have been granted one of your projects. I have been given the responsibility of analysis and requirements manager for our group; “Zuntechi” and this includes communication with you, our client. Our successful bid was for the Route Editor for a climbing guidebook website. Our group is very excited to work with you and we have many ideas for the implementation of the criteria given. We would like to arrange a meeting between our group and yourself in order to further discuss the project and build up a work relationship.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Kind regards,

Emmanuel Onah
