Hi Emmanuel, 

Sorry for the confusion last night. Hopefully that email I sent through Liam made sense and helps. Let me know if you've got any questions about getting set up with Git or using the GitHub repository. 

If you have any problems we could always meet on Thursday after 5pm?

Cheers

Ryan
