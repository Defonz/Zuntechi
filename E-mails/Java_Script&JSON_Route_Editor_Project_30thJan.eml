Dear Ryan,

My name is Emmanuel Onah and I am currently a second year computer 
science student at Bangor University. This semester for our software hut 
module we have been granted one of your projects. I have been given the 
responsibility of analysis and requirements manager for our group; 
“Zuntechi” and this includes communication with you, our client. Our 
successful bid was for the Route Editor for a climbing guidebook 
website. Our group is very excited to work with you and we have many 
ideas for the implementation of the criteria given. We would like to 
arrange a meeting between our group and yourself in order to further 
discuss the project and build up a work relationship.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Kind regards,

Emmanuel Onah
